# Stocktake

An app to aid in the **stocktake** process for bars 

## Ideas

### 1. What are stocktakes?

Stocktakes are a fundamental component of running a hospitality business. Their purpose is to track *ingredients/items* that the business uses on their premesis that are involved in the process of *creating a product* for the customer (e.g, cocktails, meals), which collectively we refer to as **stock**. The tracking of stock is useful to know:

- That there is enough stock for service (i.e, as to not run out of something)
- Can be used to track the wastage of certain items (and also monitor theft)
- Makes the ordering of items easier as stock needs to be prepared in advance (bars usually order their items on a weekly/fortnightly basis)

### 2. How are they performed?

Stocktakes are performed on different timeframes depending on the business, and there are different levels of stocktakes. The level of the stocktake being performed is really what depth one goes to: 

- A daily stocktake could consist of a quick run through of what key items (generally perishables) are on hand for that particular day of service
- A weekly stocktake would generally contain the items checked in the daily stocktake aswell as items that are ordered in bulk/weekly basis
- A less frequent quarterly/yearly stocktake which would encompass all items on the premsises in particular items that aren't ordered often (e.g., glassware, furniture)

For each level of stocktake, each *item* will have a *level* for which the *quantity/amount* of that item is to maintained at. When the stocktake is performed, the 
current level of the item is compared to the desired level to find how much is needed to order.
